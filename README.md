# Overview

ChalkBoard is a learning management system (LMS) that serves as an alternative to City University of New York's (CUNY) BlackBoard. To address the concerns of users when using BlackBoard, the group decided to plan and make a learning management application with ease of usage as the top priority.

# Description

ChalkBoard has a minimilastic yet modern-looking user interface (UI) to help users navigate more easily in the application. The information displayed are made succinct to avoid clutter and improve user experience (UX) when using the application. The application is also mobile-friendly to be more accessible to various devices among users.

Chalkboard lets a user create their own account using the organization-provided email (in this case, xxxxx@chalkboard.edu). Privileges granted depend on the account type, whether a Staff or a Student. Staff accounts have access to all Student accounts' information, assign new homeworks, as well as grade them. On the other hand, Student accounts only have access to their respective homeworks and grades.

Three main sections of Chalkboard are:

*   Homepage
*   Assignments
*   Grades

The Homepage contains important alerts, the list of courses that the user is enrolled at, and the recently graded homeworks. In the course list, a user can add a course with the term, subject, course code, and course name.

In the Assignments page, a Student account can see all past and upcoming homeworks. In addition to those features, a Staff account can also set future homeworks, and comment on submissions.

In the Grades page, a Staff can view multiple student grades, set grades for submitted homeworks, and set upcoming homeworks as well. Information such as the assignment name, due date, date updated, and grade will be displayed for the user. However, a Student user can only choose and click on an existing course to view the all the homeworks for that particular course.

# Future Improvements

In the future, the group would like to implement several more features such as:

1. Profile Page - to view and change the user's account information.

2. Attendance Page - to keep track of a user's class attendance in each course.

3. Password Change - to add a layer of security for users as well as a reset password functionality in case a user forgets their password.
